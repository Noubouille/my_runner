# my_runner
An Epitech graphical projet where we need to create a runner game.
My game was inspired by the Chrome dinosaur game who appear as an easter egg when we are offline.

## Main feature

- Customized map! You can add more or less obstacles directly into the map.

## Custom map

It was a requirement for our game, to have a card, customizable by the user.

My map file, map.txt - one '1' represent one obstacle and was represented by a cactus into the game.

You can add as many obstacles you want by adding '1' value into the file.
All spaces and other values other than '1' are ignored.

## How to run it

- Clone this repository
- Execute the **make** command
- (Optionnal : **make clean** to clear useless files)
- Execute the game by using ./my_runner map.txt
- Have fun !
